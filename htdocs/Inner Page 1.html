				<h2>What I've done and am doing</h2>
					<p>I am currently at AR 56, which means I have been playing for quite some time now. I initially started playing this game because I was bored,<br> I saw this game on the play store and thought it might be fun, and here I am enjoying playing this game everyday. I started playing on the<br> 10th of October, 2020 and had fun but I stopped playing for a long while until I decided to play again at around July 2021 and have continued<br> playing since. And I enjoy my time in gme, even if I just play for a few minutes.<br>I've been basically completed everything in the game so ar, so I'm only waiting for new updates to come out, because as it stands know there isn't much to do, so I'm excited for new content.</p>

				<h2>Who I have</h2>
					<p>The characters are the most important part of the game, they make the story interesting and as a Gacha game, Genshin impact centers its profit through the collecting of these characters. These are the characters I have. In this game some characters are allocated the 5-star rarity which basically means they are harder to get. The most important of these 5-star characters to me is Klee and Arataki Itto. Klee was the first 5-star I got, and getting her sparked my inspiration to play this game more, as 5-stars are generally more fun to play. Arataki Itto is my favorite character in terms of personality and I knew I wanted to get him the moment I saw what type of character he was. </p>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>This game was one of my greatest sources of joy during the pandemic, I liked watching the story and researching about characters and their best equipment. It was easy to get lost in the game. And I like what I've done with it so far.</p>
