				<h2 class="fin">Mondstadt</h2>
					<p>The game's main story is divided in things called Archon Quests, each region of the game's world: "Teyvat" gets one. And the first region people travel to is Mondstadt, this is considered the introductory quest. We learn that our (the main character's sibling) has been captured by an unknown god, thus we start our journey to find them. We then travel to Mondstadt to try and find their god, but get caught up in the nation's problems (which will become a running theme). We help them save their nation and we form many good relationships with the people there.<br> I think this is a very good introductory quest it familiarized me with general information with Teyvat and what would become the main villains of the story, an organization called the Fatui.</p>

				<h2 class="fin">Liyue</h2>
					<p>And after we saved Mondstadt, we then go to Liyue to find their god. Unfortunately right after we get there their god dies, and we were deemed suspicious and had to run. We meet the villain of this story, although we don't know that yet. We then adventure with a mysterious man to prepare for the funeral of the god. The main villain reveals his plan and unleashes a sealed god to drown the nation and lure its god out. But with the help of the government and the magical creatures that protect the nation we defeat the god. We also learn that the mysterious man that we adventured with was the god all along. This was another excellent quest, we get to meet more new characters with very interesting personalities. The build-up was good and the pay-off was even better. </p>

				<h2 class="fin">Inazuma</h2>
					<p>Aiming to find more answers our character sneaks into the next nation, Inazuma, this part of the story is where our character becomes more apathetic, having already been caught up in a nation's problems two times, they become unwilling to get caught up again and only aim to meet their god. Although after seeing how severe the problem is they ultimately decide to help. The problem this time is that Inazuma's god has been confiscating visions, which are items that enable characters to control the element, these visions are directly tied to one's ambitions so taking them away takes away their ambition too. We then join the resistance an army that opposes the taking away of visions. We eventually get through to Inazuma's god and they decide to give back everyone's visions. I liked the story, it had a very different tone than the other two, it had a more unwelcoming aura around it, although it felt rushed, and some of the important characters ended up not having much impact on the story.</p>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>Although I only talked about the main story, the game still has so many interesting stories to be seen through side quests and artifacts. The story is something that motivates me to continue playing the game</p>
