				<h2>Importance of characters</h2>
					<p>As I said, Genshin Impact is a gacha game, these kinds of games usually sell themselves with the characters. By making them have appealing personalities and appearances, players are more likely to spend money for them. And the characters in Genshin Impact are exceptionally written, and some I like more than others, I'll be talking about them now!</p>

				<h2>Who I like</h2>
					<p>Razor (the one on the left) was the first character I got (aside from the free ones) and because of that he's very special to me, although I don't play with him anymore. Klee (on the far right) was of course my first 5-star character and she made my playing experience much better as she deals a lot of damage, and she's cute too! Albedo ( the third one from the left) is Klee's adoptive brother, so I of course wanted to get him, I also like his mysterious and soft personality. And last but not least,Arataki Itto (the one in the middle) is definitely my favorite character so far, he has such a fun personality, although intimidating, he is also very kind-hearted, he is an oni as he likes to say a lot, which is a demonic creature in Japanese folklore. This is what I like about Genshin Impact it bases characters off of real culture and makes very good sure that it's represented correctly.</p>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>Characters are normally very hard to write, so it's amazing that all the characters in Genshin Impact were made with so much research and care.</p>
